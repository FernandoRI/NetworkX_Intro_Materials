TO:     All workshop participants

SUBJ:   Welcome to NetworkX Introduction Workshop

Greetings social network hackers!

Aric and I are very excited to see so many people signed up for our workshop at Sunbelt XXX, "NetworkX introduction: Hacking social networks using the Python programming language."  This email confirms your registrations; we are looking forward to meeting everyone and spending some time together learning NetworkX.  

Our plan is for this workshop to be very interactive.  As such, to fully participate you will need to bring a laptop with all of the required workshop package software pre-installed.   We have created a page on the NetworkX developer's site at https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/wiki/workshop which provides information and links to the software tools you will need.

We are planning for the last portion of the workshop to be driven by your own interests in analyzing social networks.  We hope you will bring some of your own data or ideas and we will help you get your data loaded and start working on analysis or algorithms.

All for now, please feel free to send Aric and I any questions, comments or concerns you have regarding the workshop between now and Sunbelt.  Again, we are both very eager to meet everyone and begin hacking social networks!

Best,
Drew Conway (agc282@nyu.edu)
